# FluxionDB

FluxionDB is an in-memory time series database exposed over WebSockets. The server keeps hot data in RAM, can optionally persist to disk, and speaks a compact protocol that is shared by the official Node.js and Go client SDKs shipped in this repository.

## Highlights

-   Sub-millisecond inserts and queries backed by an in-memory collection store
-   Compact WebSocket protocol with query-parameter auth and tokenised message types (`ins`, `qry`, …)
-   Optional persistence when a data folder is supplied
-   First-party clients:
    -   Node.js SDK (`clients/node`) published as `@volandoo/fluxiondb-client`
    -   Go SDK (`clients/go`) with examples and docs
-   Docker image (`volandoo/fluxiondb`) for single-command deployment

---

## Running the Server

### Docker (recommended)

```sh
# Pull the upstream image
docker pull volandoo/fluxiondb:latest

# Run the server
docker run --init --rm -it -p 8080:8080 \
    -v $(pwd)/tmp_data:/app/data volandoo/fluxiondb:latest \
    --secret-key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY --data=/app/data
```

To build the image from source:

```sh
make build
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY make run
```

### Native Build (Qt 6)

```sh
qmake6 fluxiondb.pro
make
./fluxiondb --secret-key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY --data=/path/to/data
```

Arguments:

-   `--secret-key` (required) secures client connections.
-   `--data` (optional) enables persistence by pointing to a writable directory. Omit to run fully in-memory.

## WebSocket Protocol Overview

All requests are JSON documents. Clients authenticate during the WebSocket handshake by providing an `api-key` query parameter in the connection URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080?api-key=YOUR_KEY`). Supply the master key for full access, or a scoped key that you created with the `keys` management message. The legacy `auth` message is no longer accepted by the server.

| Type      | Purpose                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ins`     | Insert one or more records                        |
| `qry`     | Fetch latest record per document                  |
| `cols`    | List collections                                  |
| `qdoc`    | Fetch records for a document                      |
| `ddoc`    | Delete a document                                 |
| `dcol`    | Delete a collection                               |
| `drec`    | Delete a single record                            |
| `dmrec`   | Delete multiple records                           |
| `drrng`   | Delete records within a timestamp range           |
| `sval`    | Set key-value entry                               |
| `gval`    | Get key-value entry                               |
| `gvalues` | Get key-value entries by literal key or `/regex/` |
| `rval`    | Remove key-value entry                            |
| `gvals`   | Fetch all key-value entries                       |
| `gkeys`   | Fetch all keys                                    |
| `keys`    | Manage API keys (add/remove scoped keys)          |
| `conn`    | List active client connections (IP, elapsed ms, optional name) |

The `doc` field in `qry` requests and the `key` field in `gvalues` requests both accept `/pattern/flags` strings (e.g. `/device-.*/i`). Literal values continue to work as before; the server only compiles the expression when the payload starts with `/` and contains a trailing `/`.

Clients may also include an optional `name` query parameter during the WebSocket handshake (`?api-key=...&name=my-sdk`). The server echoes that label in `conn` responses so you can tell which socket is which.

### API Key Scopes

The built-in master key always has full access, cannot be removed, and is the only credential allowed to create or revoke other keys. Scoped keys created via the `keys` message support three levels:

-   `readonly` – query-only access.
-   `read_write` – read and insert/update operations.
-   `read_write_delete` – full access, including destructive operations.

Both clients handle the JSON marshalling for you, as well as appending the API key to the connection URL.

### Managing API Keys Manually

To create or revoke scoped keys without an SDK, send a `keys` message after the socket is established (using the master key in the handshake):

```json
{
    "id": "create-1",
    "type": "keys",
    "data": "{\"action\":\"add\",\"key\":\"analytics-reader\",\"scope\":\"readonly\"}"
}
```

Removing a key works the same way:

```json
{
    "id": "remove-1",
    "type": "keys",
    "data": "{\"action\":\"remove\",\"key\":\"analytics-reader\"}"
}
```

Responses include the original `id` plus a `"status": "ok"` field on success, or `"error"` when the operation is rejected. The master key always retains `read_write_delete` scope and cannot be removed.

## Node.js Client

Install from npm:

```sh
npm install @volandoo/fluxiondb-client
```

Example:

```ts
import { FluxionDBClient } from "@volandoo/fluxiondb-client";

const client = new FluxionDBClient({ url: "ws://localhost:8080", apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" });

const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
await client.insertMultipleRecords([
    { ts: now, doc: "device-1", data: JSON.stringify({ temperature: 22.5 }), col: "sensors" },
]);

const collections = await client.fetchCollections();
console.log(collections);

// Match a subset of documents using /regex/ patterns
const latest = await client.fetchLatestRecords({
    col: "sensors",
    ts: now,
    doc: "/device-[12]/",
});
console.log(latest);

const history = await client.fetchDocument({
    col: "sensors",
    doc: "device-1",
    from: now - 3600,
    to: now,
});
console.log(history);

// Fetch key/value entries using a literal key or /regex/
const envConfig = await client.getValues({
    col: "config",
    key: "/env\\..*/",
});
console.log(envConfig);

const connections = await client.getConnections();
console.log(connections);

client.close();
```

Scoped access can be provisioned at runtime:

```ts
await client.addApiKey({ key: "sensor-reader", scope: "readonly" });
await client.removeApiKey({ key: "sensor-reader" });
```

Call `client.getValues({ col })` to dump every key/value pair, or include `key` (literal or `/regex/`) to let the server filter before sending results.

The full TypeScript source, tests, and build tooling live under `clients/node/`.

## Go Client

Add the module:

```sh
go get github.com/volandoo/fluxiondb/clients/go
```

Example:

```go
client := fluxiondb.NewClient("ws://localhost:8080", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
if err := client.Connect(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer client.Close()

now := time.Now().Unix()
_ = client.InsertSingleDocumentRecord(fluxiondb.InsertMessageRequest{
    TS:   now,
    Doc:  "device-1",
    Data: `{"temperature":22.5}`,
    Col:  "sensors",
})

latest, _ := client.FetchLatestRecords(fluxiondb.FetchLatestRecordsParams{
    Col: "sensors",
    TS:  now,
    Doc: "/device-[12]/",
})
fmt.Println(latest)

pattern := "/env\\..*/"
envVars, _ := client.GetValues(fluxiondb.GetValuesParams{
    Col: "config",
    Key: &pattern,
})
fmt.Println(envVars)

connections, _ := client.GetConnections()
fmt.Println(connections)
```

See `clients/go/README.md` and the example app in `clients/go/example/` for more.

Omit the `Key` pointer when calling `client.GetValues` to return the entire collection, or set it to a literal/`/regex/` string to reduce the payload.

## Development

-   `make build` – build the Docker image
-   `SECRET_KEY=dev make run` – run the server in Docker with persistence mounted at `tmp_data/`
-   `qmake6 fluxiondb.pro && make` – native build (requires Qt 6 Core + WebSockets)
-   `cd clients/node && npm install && npm run build` – build Node client bundle
-   `cd clients/go && go test ./...` – run Go client tests

### Repository Layout

-   `src/` – Qt/C++17 server sources
-   `clients/node/` – Node.js SDK (TypeScript)
-   `clients/go/` – Go SDK
-   `tmp_data/` – sample data mount point when running locally
